LoreLocker is an app concept based on Android Knowledge's tutorial video on making a Notes App using the SQLite Database in Kotlin. (https://youtu.be/BVAslimaGSk?si=6pR9UBXH2vydBT6B)

I added some tweaks in the code to allow for separate vault entries instead of only using one vault for all the notes.
